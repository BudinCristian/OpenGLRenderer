# OpenGL Renderer

## Overview
This OpenGL Renderer is designed to render mech models with textures, employing geometry, vertex, and fragment shaders. It incorporates various advanced features to enhance realism and immersion in the rendered scenes.

## Features

1. **Mech Rendering with Textures**: Renders complex mech models with textures applied.
2. **Shaders**: Utilizes geometry, vertex, and fragment shaders for realistic rendering.
3. **Lighting**: Implements both positional and directional lighting for enhanced realism.
4. **Shadow Mapping**: Computes shadows using shadow mapping techniques for accurate shadow representation. Cube mapping is employed for comprehensive shadow effects.
5. **Skybox**: Incorporates a skybox to provide immersive environments.
6. **Camera Animation**: Enables camera animation through B-splines, allowing for smooth and dynamic movement.
7. **Shadow Anti-Aliasing**: Employs the Percentage Closer Filtering (PCF) depth algorithm for shadow anti-aliasing, resulting in smoother shadow transitions.
8. **Camera Movement**: Facilitates intuitive camera movement for exploration and interaction.
9. **Fog Effects**: Implements fog effects to enhance atmosphere and depth perception.
